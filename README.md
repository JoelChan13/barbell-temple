## **Relational Database Diagram**

* The project uses a relational database (sqlite3)

**Models**

* **BarbellClass**
    * The BarbellClass model represents a barbell class with various attributes detailing the class information:
        * title: A string field for the class title, with a maximum length of 100 characters.
        * image: A Cloudinary field to handle image uploads, defaulting to a placeholder if not provided.
        * date_posted: A datetime field automatically set to the current time when the class is created, not editable.
        * author: A foreign key linking to the User model, indicating the creator of the class.
        * class_datetime: A datetime field specifying when the class will occur, with the default set to the current time.
        * duration: A text field for the class duration description.
        * difficulty: A choice field allowing selection among 'Beginner', 'Intermediate', and 'Advanced' difficulty levels, defaulting to 'Beginner'.
        * description: A text field for a detailed description of the class.
        * available_spots: An integer field indicating the number of available spots for the class.

* **Enrollment**
    * The Enrollment model manages the enrollment of users in barbell classes:
        * user: A foreign key linking to the User model, representing the enrolling user.
        * barbell_class: A foreign key linking to the BarbellClass model, representing the class the user is enrolling in.
        * date_enrolled: A datetime field automatically set to the current time when the enrollment is created.

* **Profile**
    *  the Profile model extends the default Django User model to include a profile picture, with added functionality to ensure images are appropriately sized. This model is essential for maintaining additional user information within the Barbell Class application.
    * The Profile model represents a user's profile with a one-to-one relationship to the Django User model, providing additional attributes:
        * user: A one-to-one field linking to the User model, ensuring each user has one unique profile.
        * image: An image field for storing profile pictures, with a default image if none is uploaded, and specifying the upload directory as profile_pictures.
    
## **Design Choices**

* **Wireframes**
    * Skeleton structure for website was created by hand.

* **Background**
    * Background image for webpage was created using Microsoft Copilot Image Creator by providing information related to fitness inspired by greek mythology and fitness.

## **Colour Choices**

Due to the nature of the background image, the colour choices chosen were kept as minimalist as possible not to create a busy environment which may distract users from the purpose of the website.

# **Bugs during development**

## **Fixed bugs and solutions:**

## **Ongoing bugs:**

# **Development and deployment**

The development environment used for this project was initially CodeInstitute's IDE, however due to CodeInstitute migrating to a different service, GitPod was later used to compile the project. Commits and pushes to Github were performed on a regular basis to to be able to track and trace the development process of the website. The Gitpod environment for this particular project was created using a template provided by Code Institute. The project was eventually deployed to Heroku in order to make use of its optimal database maintenance capabilities.

# **Credits**
